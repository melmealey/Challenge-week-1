## Description

The codebase is much more accessibile now. I made sure to change the title to match what you see when you open the webpage. The icon and image elements now have alt attributes, making the website more accecible for the visually impared. I have changed the non-semantic html to sematic html where it made sense and would be helpful. I also consolidated the CSS code in order to visually look more appealing and follow the layout of the html. I learned so much with this editing and even turned on the accessibiiltiy features on my computer so that I could see how the changes I made affected the website outcome.
